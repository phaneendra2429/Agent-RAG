# Agentic-RAG
 
 ### Readme.md
   Here's a brief explanation of each package listed in your `requirements.txt` file:

   1. **langchain**: This is likely a library for building language models or working with natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It might provide tools for chaining together different language processing components.

   2. **langgraph**: This could be a library related to graph-based language processing or visualization. It might be used for representing language data in graph form.

   3. **cassio**: This package is used for initializing an Astra DB database, which is a cloud-native database service built on Apache Cassandra.

   4. **langchain_community**: Community-driven extension or plugin for the `langchain` library, providing additional features or integrations.

   5. **tiktoken**: This package could be related to tokenization, which is the process of converting text into tokens (smaller pieces) for processing in NLP tasks.

   6. **langchain-groq**: This might be a specialized version or extension of `langchain` that integrates with Groq, which could be a hardware or software platform for accelerating machine learning tasks.

   7. **langchainhub**: This could be a repository or hub for sharing and discovering `langchain` components, models, or resources.

   8. **langchain_huggingface**: This is likely an integration between `langchain` and Hugging Face, a popular platform for NLP models and datasets, providing access to pre-trained models and other resources.

   > Please note that the exact purpose of each package can vary based on the specific implementation and context within your project.
